Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar created by Eric Wastl ([@topaz](https://github.com/topaz)). It has been running since 2015.

The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private leaderboards.

This repository contains **my** solutions for the puzzles written in C. Just wanted to improve my C skills, I guess...

The code may not be the best performing code ever but does the job.
